# DgramStudio

This project is the future replace of "Diagramar",
 a desktop application used by "Universidad Nacional de
Salta" (a.k.a. UNSa), in the first year of the IT careers to
learn the basics of programming and some algorithms with
block diagrams.

## Why?

This project aims to be a modern replace for "Diagramar", which
is made on C# and .NET, by the year 2009, which, as you may already figured
out, nowadays has a lot of annoying bugs.

With Java and JavaFX as the main languages, the project (the
application) won't have problems with the pace of time as happened
with the original application.

**¡This is not a Pseint replacement!**
